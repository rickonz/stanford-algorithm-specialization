# Algorithm Specialization - Offered by Stanford University 

Python solutions to problem sets and programming assignments in the [Stanford Algorithm Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) on Coursera.

**About this Specialization**

Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and the subject has countless practical applications as well as intellectual depth.  This specialization is an introduction to algorithms for learners with at least a little programming experience.  The specialization is rigorous but emphasizes the big picture and conceptual understanding over low-level implementation and mathematical details.  After completing this specialization, you will be well-positioned to ace your technical interviews and speak fluently about algorithms with other programmers and computer scientists.

**About the instructor**
